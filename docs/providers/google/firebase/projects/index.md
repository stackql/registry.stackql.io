## Overview
<table><tbody>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><code>projects</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td>Resource</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Id</b></td><td><code>google.firebase.projects</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `results` | `array` | One page of the list of Projects that are accessible to the caller. |
| `nextPageToken` | `string` | If the result list is too large to fit in a single response, then a token is returned. If the string is empty, then this response is the last page of results. This token can be used in a subsequent calls to `ListFirebaseProjects` to find the next group of Projects. Page tokens are short-lived and should not be persisted. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `projectsId` | Gets the configuration artifact associated with the specified WebApp. |
| `list` | `SELECT` |  | Lists each FirebaseProject accessible to the caller. The elements are returned in no particular order, but they will be a consistent view of the Projects when additional requests are made with a `pageToken`. This method is eventually consistent with Project mutations, which means newly provisioned Projects and recent modifications to existing Projects might not be reflected in the set of Projects. The list will include only ACTIVE Projects. Use GetFirebaseProject for consistent reads as well as for additional Project details. |
| `addFirebase` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Adds Firebase resources to the specified existing [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) `Project`] (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects). Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP `Project`, a `FirebaseProject` has the same underlying GCP identifiers (`projectNumber` and `projectId`). This allows for easy interop with Google APIs. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to a FirebaseProject; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. This method does not modify any billing account information on the underlying GCP `Project`. To call `AddFirebase`, a project member or service account must have the following permissions (the IAM roles of Editor and Owner contain these permissions): `firebase.projects.update`, `resourcemanager.projects.get`, `serviceusage.services.enable`, and `serviceusage.services.get`. |
| `addGoogleAnalytics` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Links the specified FirebaseProject with an existing [Google Analytics account](http://www.google.com/analytics/). Using this call, you can either: - Specify an `analyticsAccountId` to provision a new Google Analytics property within the specified account and associate the new property with the `FirebaseProject`. - Specify an existing `analyticsPropertyId` to associate the property with the `FirebaseProject`. Note that when you call `AddGoogleAnalytics`: 1. The first check determines if any existing data streams in the Google Analytics property correspond to any existing Firebase Apps in the `FirebaseProject` (based on the `packageName` or `bundleId` associated with the data stream). Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property. Learn more about the hierarchy and structure of Google Analytics accounts in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9303323). The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to an AnalyticsDetails; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. To call `AddGoogleAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the existing `FirebaseProject` and have the [`Edit` permission](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) for the Google Analytics account. If the `FirebaseProject` already has Google Analytics enabled, and you call `AddGoogleAnalytics` using an `analyticsPropertyId` that's different from the currently associated property, then the call will fail. Analytics may have already been enabled in the Firebase console or by specifying `timeZone` and `regionCode` in the call to [`AddFirebase`](../../v1beta1/projects/addFirebase). |
| `getAdminSdkConfig` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Gets the configuration artifact associated with the specified WebApp. |
| `getAnalyticsDetails` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Gets the configuration artifact associated with the specified WebApp. |
| `patch` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Updates the attributes of the specified WebApp. |
| `removeAnalytics` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Unlinks the specified FirebaseProject from its Google Analytics account. This call removes the association of the specified `FirebaseProject` with its current Google Analytics property. However, this call does not delete the Google Analytics resources, such as the Google Analytics property or any data streams. These resources may be re-associated later to the `FirebaseProject` by calling [`AddGoogleAnalytics`](../../v1beta1/projects/addGoogleAnalytics) and specifying the same `analyticsPropertyId`. For Android Apps and iOS Apps, this call re-links data streams with their corresponding apps. However, for Web Apps, this call provisions a *new* data stream for each Web App. To call `RemoveAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the `FirebaseProject`. |
| `searchApps` | `EXEC` | `projectsId` | Lists all available Apps for the specified FirebaseProject. This is a convenience method. Typically, interaction with an App should be done using the platform-specific service, but some tool use-cases require a summary of all known Apps (such as for App selector interfaces). |
