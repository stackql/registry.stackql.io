|:-----|:---------|:------------|

| `nextPageToken` | `string` | Token identifying the next page of results to return. If empty, no further results are available. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `guardianId, studentId` | Returns a specific guardian. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if no user that matches the provided `student_id` is visible to the requesting user, if the requesting user is not permitted to view guardian information for the student identified by the `student_id`, if guardians are not enabled for the domain in question, or for other access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a `student_id` is specified, but its format cannot be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `student_id` from the API, nor the literal string `me`). * `NOT_FOUND` if the requesting user is permitted to view guardians for the requested `student_id`, but no `Guardian` record exists for that student that matches the provided `guardian_id`. |
| `list` | `SELECT` | `studentId` | Returns a list of guardians that the requesting user is permitted to view, restricted to those that match the request. To list guardians for any student that the requesting user may view guardians for, use the literal character `-` for the student ID. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if a `student_id` is specified, and the requesting user is not permitted to view guardian information for that student, if `"-"` is specified as the `student_id` and the user is not a domain administrator, if guardians are not enabled for the domain in question, if the `invited_email_address` filter is set by a user who is not a domain administrator, or for other access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a `student_id` is specified, but its format cannot be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `student_id` from the API, nor the literal string `me`). May also be returned if an invalid `page_token` is provided. * `NOT_FOUND` if a `student_id` is specified, and its format can be recognized, but Classroom has no record of that student. |
| `delete` | `DELETE` | `guardianId, studentId` | Deletes a guardian. The guardian will no longer receive guardian notifications and the guardian will no longer be accessible via the API. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if no user that matches the provided `student_id` is visible to the requesting user, if the requesting user is not permitted to manage guardians for the student identified by the `student_id`, if guardians are not enabled for the domain in question, or for other access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a `student_id` is specified, but its format cannot be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `student_id` from the API). * `NOT_FOUND` if the requesting user is permitted to modify guardians for the requested `student_id`, but no `Guardian` record exists for that student with the provided `guardian_id`. |
