## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | Resource name of the settings. Required for the SecuritySettingsService.UpdateSecuritySettings method. SecuritySettingsService.CreateSecuritySettings populates the name automatically. Format: `projects//locations//securitySettings/`. |
| `retentionWindowDays` | `integer` | Retains data in interaction logging for the specified number of days. This does not apply to Cloud logging, which is owned by the user - not Dialogflow. User must set a value lower than Dialogflow's default 365d TTL. Setting a value higher than that has no effect. A missing value or setting to 0 also means we use Dialogflow's default TTL. Note: Interaction logging is a limited access feature. Talk to your Google representative to check availability for you. |
| `insightsExportSettings` | `object` | Settings for exporting conversations to [Insights](https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/insights/docs). |
| `inspectTemplate` | `string` | [DLP](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs) inspect template name. Use this template to define inspect base settings. The `DLP Inspect Templates Reader` role is needed on the Dialogflow service identity service account (has the form `service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) for your agent's project. If empty, we use the default DLP inspect config. The template name will have one of the following formats: `projects//locations//inspectTemplates/` OR `organizations//locations//inspectTemplates/` Note: `inspect_template` must be located in the same region as the `SecuritySettings`. |
| `purgeDataTypes` | `array` | List of types of data to remove when retention settings triggers purge. |
| `audioExportSettings` | `object` | Settings for exporting audio. |
| `redactionStrategy` | `string` | Strategy that defines how we do redaction. |
| `displayName` | `string` | Required. The human-readable name of the security settings, unique within the location. |
| `redactionScope` | `string` | Defines the data for which Dialogflow applies redaction. Dialogflow does not redact data that it does not have access to â€“ for example, Cloud logging. |
| `deidentifyTemplate` | `string` | [DLP](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs) deidentify template name. Use this template to define de-identification configuration for the content. The `DLP De-identify Templates Reader` role is needed on the Dialogflow service identity service account (has the form `service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) for your agent's project. If empty, Dialogflow replaces sensitive info with `[redacted]` text. The template name will have one of the following formats: `projects//locations//deidentifyTemplates/` OR `organizations//locations//deidentifyTemplates/` Note: `deidentify_template` must be located in the same region as the `SecuritySettings`. |
