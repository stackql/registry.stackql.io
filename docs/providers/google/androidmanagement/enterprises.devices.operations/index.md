## Fields
| Name | Datatype | Description |
|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | `string` | The name of the web app, which is generated by the server during creation in the form enterprises/{enterpriseId}/webApps/{packageName}. |
| `title` | `string` | The title of the web app as displayed to the user (e.g., amongst a list of other applications, or as a label for an icon). |
| `versionCode` | `string` | The current version of the app.Note that the version can automatically increase during the lifetime of the web app, while Google does internal housekeeping to keep the web app up-to-date. |
| `displayMode` | `string` | The display mode of the web app. |
| `icons` | `array` | A list of icons for the web app. Must have at least one element. |
| `startUrl` | `string` | The start URL, i.e. the URL that should load when the user opens the application. |
## Methods
| Name | Accessible by | Required Params | Description |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `get` | `SELECT` | `devicesId, enterprisesId, operationsId` | Gets a web app. |
| `list` | `SELECT` | `devicesId, enterprisesId` | Gets a web app. |
| `delete` | `DELETE` | `devicesId, enterprisesId, operationsId` | Deletes a web app. |
| `cancel` | `EXEC` | `devicesId, enterprisesId, operationsId` | Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to Code.CANCELLED. |
